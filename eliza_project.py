"""
Streamlit webpage to provide a list of followers and followings on Instagram, as well as
the subtraction of those sets.
Requires downloading the Instagram-provided JSON files.

Requested by Eliza - 7-14-2024.

ToDo:
- How to spread out the columns more: give more space to the df and make the graph not go so far out??
(if you change the columns back to being the df and the graph, instead of stats and df)
- change the hover text on graph to also show date, maybe time
- show multiple lines on same chart?


- refactor process data repeated part?

- Add more info to the "time" column in the df
- Figure out how to expand the df/more visually appealing



- Document the set theory relationship (219 | 403 | 105)



Done:
- Figure out weird caching thing - why does it save data no matter the input?????
    -- had to delete the directory everytime a new file was uploaded. this involved using session state to track the
    current file, and use shutil to remove directory
- add bullet points for initial text if expanding capabilities of website
- Get the error message for inputted files working.
- Possibly a graph of followers v. following over time?????
