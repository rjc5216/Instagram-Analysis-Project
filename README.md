# Instagram Analysis
Streamlit-based Python project that allows users to analyze their followers/following on Instgram.

How to download the required JSON files:
  - Go to Instgram settings
  - Search and select "download your information"
  - Make sure you select "followers" and "following" in the connections section.

Once users upload these files, they can see tables of their followers, following, accounts they follow who don't follow them back, and vice versa,
along with datetime data provided by Instagram and basic Plotly visualization.
